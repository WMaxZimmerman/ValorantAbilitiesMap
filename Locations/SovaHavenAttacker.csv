51|352|364|Stand just behind the left corner of Courtyard. Crouch and put the center of your crosshair on the little knick that is on the right post. You cant see the mark in the picture or int the video, but its pretty easy to see in game. Release with full power and 2 bounces. This will land right on the boxes that defenders like to sit on and watch B. https://youtu.be/6Iij8kAIwio
53|264|364|Stand so that the left side of the box lines up with the corner of the left post of B Site. Then aim so that your crosshair is in the center of the post, and so that the bottom of the bounce indicator is above the second horizontal line on the box. The height line up for this isnt very specific. Release with full power and 2 bounces. This will land on the boxes to the right of B Site. https://youtu.be/UnEsaX27nec
54|74|459|This isnt a specific setup, if youâ€™re anywhere in the general area this will reveal most of A site. The one I show lands above heaven, and is the correct height for reaching down into the connector to A Long. https://youtu.be/kpNm1ffrCc8
56|533|466|This has a pretty specific standing location, and I am looking for a better setup for this. Aim so that your right crosshair is on the second leaf down from the top. Release with 1 bar and no bounces. This lands on the slanted roof at the back of site, and gives vision of the whole site. https://youtu.be/J_oXO2bEGg8
